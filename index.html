                <p class="firstp">Don's personality is affected by two things; his insane life as a drug lord, mobster and international criminal, and his frequent and heavy abuse of multiple different drugs and copious amounts of alcohol.
                <br>    

                Mr. Wick is very upbeat and outgoing. He likes to make new friends and is quite trustworthy. He goes out of his way to help his friends and is loyal and loving to those he considers close to him, although he can come across as belittling and offensive but it is all light hearted banter on his part. Wick's number one goal is to keep the party going, even if that involves illegal actions to fund it.
                </p>
        
            
                <p class="secondp">
                    Even though Wick may come across as a crazy, erratic buzz junkie, there is more beneath the surface; Wick's mind is thinking up new tricks, he has street smarts and experience in "underworld" activities as well as links in all kinds of places. When you look past the loud, erratic, drug-fueled visage you realize that Don Wick is a highly intelligent, cunning, tenacious and merciless individual with very little remorse for those who cross him or who he screws over.
